--Mountain_car--
You can run the code using command python mountain_car.py --task [T1/T2] --train [0/1] . If the --train is 0 the code is not expected to output anything. It should just train the agent and save the final weights and plots as T1.npy and T1.jpg or T2.npy and T2.jpg based on the --task parameter.
T1 is task and T2 is task 2
